                                <p>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer
                                    geographer and a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. He was born in Persia of
                                    that
                                    time around 780. Al-Khwarizmi was one of the learned men who worked in the House of
                                    Wisdom.
                                    Al-Khwarizmi flourished while working as a member of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad
                                    under
                                    the leadership of Kalif al-Mamun, the son of the Khalif Harun al-Rashid, who was made
                                    famous
                                    in the Arabian Nights. The House of Wisdom was a scientific research and teaching
                                    center.</p>
                                <h4><strong>Contributions and Achievements:</strong></h4>
                                <p>Al-Khwarizmi developed the concept of the algorithm in mathematics (which is a reason for
                                    his being called the grandfather of computer science by some people).</p>

                                <p>Al-Khwarizmi’s algebra is regarded as the foundation and cornerstone of the sciences. To
                                    al-Khwarizmi we owe the world “algebra,” from the title of his greatest mathematical
                                    work,
                                    Hisab al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabala. The book, which was twice translated into Latin, by both
                                    Gerard of Cremona and Robert of Chester in the 12th century, works out several hundred
                                    simple quadratic equations by analysis as well as by geometrical example. It also has
                                    substantial sections on methods of dividing up inheritances and surveying plots of land.
                                    It
                                    is largely concerned with methods for solving practical computational problems rather
                                    than
                                    algebra as the term is now understood.</p>
                                <p>Al-Khwarizmi confined his discussion to equations of the first and second degrees. He
                                    also
                                    wrote an important work on astronomy, covering calendars, calculating true positions of
                                    the
                                    sun, moon and planets, tables of sines and tangents, spherical astronomy, astrological
                                    tables, parallax and eclipse calculations, and visibility of the moon. His astronomical
                                    work, Zij al-sindhind, is also based on the work of other scientists. As with the
                                    Algebra,
                                    its chief interest is as the earliest Arab work still in existence in Arabic.</p>
                                <p>His most recognized work as mentioned above and one that is so named after him is the
                                    mathematical concept Algorithm. The modern meaning of the word relates to a specific
                                    practice for solving a particular problem. Today, people use algorithms to do addition
                                    and
                                    long division, principles that are found in Al-Khwarizmi’s text written about 1200 years
                                    ago. Al-Khwarizmi was also responsible for introducing the Arabic numbers to the West,
                                    setting in motion a process that led to the use of the nine Arabic numerals, together
                                    with
                                    the zero sign.</p>
                                <p>Of great importance also was al-Khwarizmi’s contribution to medieval geography. He
                                    systematized and corrected Ptolemy’s research in geography, using his own original
                                    findings
                                    that are entitled as Surat al-Ard (The Shape of the Earth). The text exists in a
                                    manuscript;
                                    the maps have unfortunately not been preserved, although modern scholars have been able
                                    to
                                    reconstruct them from al-Khwarizmi’s descriptions. He supervised the work of 70
                                    geographers
                                    to create a map of the then “known world”. When his work became known in Europe through
                                    Latin translations, his influence made a permanent mark on the development of science in
                                    the
                                    West.</p>
                                <p>Al-Khwarizmi made several important improvements to the theory and construction of
                                    sundials,
                                    which he inherited from his Indian and Hellenistic predecessors. He made tables for
                                    these
                                    instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations.
                                    His
                                    sundial was universal and could be observed from anywhere on the Earth. From then on,
                                    sundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the time of prayer. The shadow
                                    square, an instrument used to determine the linear height of an object, in conjunction
                                    with
                                    the alidade for angular observations, was also invented by al-Khwarizmi in ninth-century
                                    Baghdad.</p>
                                While his major contributions were the result of original research, he also did much to
                                synthesize the existing knowledge in these fields from Greek, Indian, and other sources. A
                                number of minor works were written by al-Khwarizmi on topics such as the astrolabe, on which
                                he wrote on the Jewish calendar. He also wrote a political history containing horoscopes of
                                prominent persons.
                                <h4><strong>Death:</strong></h4>
                                Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi died in c. 850 being remembered as one of the most seminal
                                scientific minds of early Islamic culture.</p>

                                    <p>Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni :Al-Biruni was a renowned scholar and polymath
                                    from Khwarazm, Iran, during the Islamic Golden Age. Often referred to as the "Father of
                                    Comparative Religion," "Father of Modern Geodesy," the founder of Indology, and the
                                    first anthropologist, he made significant contributions to various fields. Al-Biruni was
                                    proficient in physics, mathematics, astronomy, natural sciences, history, chronometry,
                                    and linguistics, and his tireless research across multiple disciplines earned him
                                    recognition and patronage from royals and powerful figures. He was heavily influenced by
                                    scholars from various cultures, particularly the Greeks, when he turned his attention to
                                    philosophy.</p>
                                    <p>A gifted linguist, al-Biruni was fluent in Khwarezmian, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit,
                                    and had knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac. He spent much of his life in Ghazni, the
                                    capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty, located in present-day Afghanistan. In 1017, after
                                    being captured during Mahmud of Ghazni's conquests, he traveled to the Indian
                                    subcontinent and studied its culture, particularly Hinduism, producing his influential
                                    work Tārīkh al-Hind (The History of India), which detailed the customs and beliefs of
                                    the Indian people.</p>
                                    <p>Al-Biruni's name comes from the Persian word "bīrūn," meaning "outskirts," reflecting
                                    his birthplace in the outskirts of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid kingdom of
                                    Khwarazm. His name was Latinized as Alberonius. He spent his early years in Khwarezm,
                                    studying a range of subjects such as Islamic jurisprudence, theology, mathematics,
                                    astronomy, and philosophy. After the Afrighid dynasty fell in 995, he moved to Bukhara
                                    and later to the court of the Ziyarid ruler Qabus. He also corresponded with other
                                    scholars, including Avicenna.</p>
