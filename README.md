# The history of Muslim scientists
[View the live project here](https://ucusergit.github.io/project1/).
<br>

The History Of Muslim Scientists project is a website that will bring you back to the middle ages and give you a better idea on what the middle we like. The website present information about one of the most influential people in the history of science. Yes! in the history of science. What if I told you that the Americas were not first discovered by Christopher Colombus, or Isaak Newton was not the first to talk about the three laws of motion or fo you know the muslim mechanical engineer that Leonardo Devinci grow up learning from his books? It is ok if you do not know, that is why you have this website. This project is created mainly to shed light on these people and inform the public about who they are and what are their contribution.<br>
Moreover, it can be useful to wide range of people who may feel the need to know this information such as, science and theology students, muslims who wanted to know more about their heritage, newly convert who are curious to know about the contribution of muslim scientists and how religion was a fuel for these people to excel as religion require them to seek knowledge and learn science. <br>

## Bugs <br>

### solved bugs <br>

* When I deployed the project to Github Pages the background image did not show. I run multiple tests and finally found the issue. It was the path of the image. I added two dots in front of the path and the image was displayed.

 ```background-image: url('../images/background.jpg')```

* I also found another bug while testing for screen responsiveness. Although I used the media queries to adjust the width. It was not responsive and it did not behave as I wanted. After using the inspect tool and a consultation, I found that the problem was caused by the size of the images. I added a css styling to ensure that the images will also change size when the type of screen is changed. It fixed the problem.

* I had the anchor a inside a button which generated an error. Fixed the error by only using tag "a" to create the button and implemention a button type.

### Unsolved bugs

At the moment there are no unsolved bugs.

## Testing

* HTML validator

    * Fixed an error in the chemistry file as I used a ul inside a ul and it was supposed to be li for the list elements. Fixed the issue and no error were found after that.
    * In the contact page, I found an error in the input tag for message. I had to remove the required option and remove the placeholder and change the type to text. No errors were found after that.
    * In the donate page, I also changed the type of the message input to text. No errors were found after that.
    * In the index page, article tags were creating an issue as they require a heading. Removed the article tags and there were no errors after that.
    * In the mathematics page, I also removed the article tag and the there was no errors after that.

    ![HTML validator green bar showing no errors](assets/readmeimages/validator.png)

* CSS validator
    * There was no error in the CSS validator.

     ![HTML validator green bar showing no errors](assets/readmeimages/cssvalidator.png)

* Lghthouse tool (accessibility)

    This test was completed for all the pages and the results are below. One error appeared on all the tests and it is related to the antivirus I have on my laptop. It always include a javascript line in my code and I could not remove it. So, lighthouse finds it each time and give me an error of uhaving unused javascript. an image of that message will be provided.

    * <ins>Chemistry page</ins> <br>

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_chemistry.png) <br><br>
            
       - The results show 100% in accessibility so it has passed the test.

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_chemistry2.png)  <br><br>

       - This part of the test shows the potential savings that we can make in term of the time required to load the page. Lighthouse call it the render-blocking resources.
       - We cannot change those services as they are outside tools that were used to build the project so we do not have any control on how they are made. These include  _Googlefonts_ and _Bootstrap_, plus my Antivirus.

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_chemistry3.png)  <br><br>

       - "Enable text compression" This part of the result also include other potential savings and it is related to the antivirus.

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_chemistry4.png)  <br><br>

       - The "minify Javascript" is about the antivirus on my computer.
       - "Serve static assets" is about the images used. I already compressed all the images and used the webp version. Except for the background image. I found that the jpg format occupied less storage than the webp format so I used used the jpg format.
       - The "unused CSS" is for Fontawesome website.

    * <ins>Contact page</ins> <br>

       - The results were similar to previous page so we will not repeat the same the provided information. <br>

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_contact.png) <br>

    * <ins>Donate page</ins> <br>

       - The results were similar to previous page so we will not repeat the same the provided information. <br>

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_donate.png) <br>

    * <ins>Index page</ins> <br>

       - The results we similar except with the performance being only 96% here. This is die to the large image in the home page. An image of the message is added below. <br>

    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_index.png) <br>
    ![lighthouse test result for chemistry page](assets/readmeimages/lh_index2.png) <br>

    * <ins>Mathematics page</ins> <br>

       - For the disciplines pages we will only run the mathematics page as they all have the same structure. <br>

# Content

* I deas and pieces of code were taken from other sources.
* Used code from the walkthrough projects: [Love Running](https://github.com/ucusergit/running-club) and [Boardwalk Games](https://github.com/ucusergit/boardwalk-games) project. I did not use chunks of code but used lines of code to fix my table as I was not sure why it is not working. Added an extra “div” as it was used in the project to fix the issue. I also used ideas to how to present a list horizontally and how to style it to fit the website colors.
* Code was used from the [Boardwalk Games](https://github.com/ucusergit/boardwalk-games) project to style the social media icons and to add CSS variables.
* Code to make the grid was taken from the [Love Running](https://github.com/ucusergit/running-club) project.
* Used ideas from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51371994/box-shadow-on-image-using-html-vs-css) to add box-shadow to a picture to get rid of added space under the image. Space was added after I used object-fit attribute.
* Also used a line of code from website [shecodes.com]https://www.shecodes.io/athena/1057-troubleshooting-a-background-image-error-in-html to troubleshoot why the background image is not displayed.
* Used [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_justify-content) to find the proper attribute to use for styling the header and the footer.
* Used two lines of code from [digitaloceans.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ css-cropping-images-object-fit) to fix distorted images. They added a “box-shadow” and “object-fit” to the image styling.
* Used code from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44449372/override-bootstrap-important) to override bootstrap to set the background color for the navigation bar and the buttons and to remove the underline from text.
* Idea were used from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9222977/justify-text-in-css) to justify a text.
