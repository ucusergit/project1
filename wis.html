                            <p>The story of Fatima al-Fihri, founder of the world's first university, can work against
                                such stereotypes. Fatima was a product of the Golden Age of Islam. She was born in
                                Tunisia in 800 AD but her father moved to Morocco for business opportunities. However,
                                the death of her father left Fatima and her sister with a vast inheritance. Fatima used
                                her newfound wealth and found the world’s first university, which began as the
                                Al-Qarawiyyin mosque and library and later turned to Al-Qarawiyyin university. “Many see
                                Al-Qarawiyyin as being the perfect example of how the Muslim faith combines the
                                spiritual with the educational”, says Al Fehria of the Islamic Post. Though not much is
                                known about Fatima, she and her sister Maryam studied Islamic Jurisprudence and
                                mathematics – in fact, Fatima was a student in her own university, Al-Qarawiyyin. Her
                                contributions to mathematics education are recorded in the Rawd-al-Qirtas (“The Garden
                                of Pages”), the definitive history of Morocco written in Arabic in 1326 C.E by the 14th
                                century historian Ibn Abi Zar. Indeed, this is the only historical source which records
                                Fatima’s life and contributions. In it, Ibn Abi Zar wrote that Fatima often spent her
                                time discussing mathematics with Maryam during the construction of Al Qarawiyyin
                                university. This worksheet is inspired by Fatima’s quest to understand mathematics.</p>
                            <p>Fatima was also known as "Umm Al-Banayn", which means "mother of sons." -- an apt title
                                given her kindness and caring for her students (Mohammed Yasser Hilali). Fatima always
                                had an interest in promoting mathematics education (Bernardi, 2016), which is why she
                                expanded the mosque area under the rule of the fifth Idrisid ruler and Sultan Yahya ibn
                                Muhammad (Diam, P196). Fatima supervised the entire construction of Al-Qarawiyyin. In
                                fact – she fasted for the entire period of construction of the mosque and library, which
                                took 2 years (857-859 AD). After its expansion, students from different parts of Muslim
                                societies gathered in this mosque to learn Islamic Jurisprudence, Fiqh, and mathematics
                                (DW, 2020). Arabic numbers were used for the first time in European mathematics at this
                                university. Famous people such as the historian Ibn Khaldoon graduated from the
                                Al-Qarawiyyin University (DW, 2020).</p>

                                <p>Maryam al-Ijliya also known as Mariam al Astrulabi: Between the 8th and 15th
                                    centuries, Muslim scholars made remarkable contributions to science, developing
                                    advanced tools in fields like medicine, astronomy, physics, and chemistry. These
                                    innovations laid the groundwork for significant progress during the Renaissance and
                                    the Age of Discovery.</p>
                                <p>Pioneering figures such as Ali al-Qushji, Ulugh Beg, Al-Biruni, and Ibn Sina opened
                                    new doors for future polymaths through their groundbreaking works. In astronomy,
                                    Muslim scholars refined the Ptolemaic system—a mathematical model of the universe
                                    created by Ptolemy in 150 CE—while identifying and addressing its limitations.
                                    Drawing on ancient knowledge from Greece, Iran, and India, they further advanced the
                                    field by inventing new instruments to measure and calculate the movements of stars
                                    and planets.</p>
                                <p>The requirements of Islamic worship also drove scientific advancements. Muslims pray
                                    five times a day based on the position of the sun and face the Kaaba in Mecca. These
                                    practices prompted innovations in timekeeping and celestial navigation during the
                                    Islamic Golden Age.</p>
                                <p>One notable figure from this era was Maryam al-Ijliya, also known as Mariam
                                    al-Astrulabi, who revolutionized the construction of astrolabes in the 10th century.
                                    Astrolabes are ancient devices used to measure time and determine the position of
                                    celestial bodies. Born in Syria, Mariam was inspired by her father, Al-Ijliyy
                                    al-Asturlabi, who had apprenticed with an astrolabe maker in Baghdad. Her work
                                    required complex mathematical calculations and precision, which she mastered over
                                    time.</p>
                                <p>Mariam’s innovative designs caught the attention of Sayf al-Dawla, the ruler of the
                                    Emirate of Aleppo, who reigned from 944 to 967 CE. Impressed by her brilliance, he
                                    employed her at his court in Aleppo, where she contributed to advancements in
                                    navigation and timekeeping.</p>
                                <h4><strong>How Mariam's Astrolabes Advanced Astronomy</strong></h4>
                                <p>Astrolabes utilize celestial bodies like the sun and stars to determine latitude,
                                    local
                                    time, and even track celestial phenomena such as the Earth's axial wobble. They
                                    consist
                                    of a metal or wooden disk marked with degrees and a movable pointer called an
                                    alidade.
                                    Astrolabes were used to determine the Qibla (direction of Mecca), prayer times, and
                                    the
                                    start of Ramadan and Eid. Beyond religious applications, they were integral to
                                    astronomy, astrology, and horoscopes. Astronomers used them to calculate the
                                    positions
                                    of celestial objects, determine the time of day or year, and measure altitudes and
                                    latitudes.</p>
                                <p>Mariam's contributions to astronomy gained formal recognition when the main-belt
                                    asteroid 7060 Al-Ijliyye was named in her honor after its discovery by Henry E. Holt
                                    at Palomar Observatory in 1990. Her legacy continues to inspire generations in
                                    science and beyond.</p>
