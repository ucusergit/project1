                                    <p>Jabir ibn Hayyan, also known as Jabir al-Kufi, he is also known as the father of
                                        chemistry. He was a scholar in philosophy, natural sciences, literature, astronomy, and
                                        chemistry. He was of Yemeni Arab Azd ancestry. After the establishment of the Abbasid
                                        Caliphate, he lived in Baghdad, with his lifespan roughly spanning from 721 CE to 815
                                        CE. Jabir is credited with founding and advancing experimental chemistry. Through
                                        experimentation and extensive reading, he made numerous discoveries in the field of
                                        chemistry, earning him titles such as "Father of Chemistry," "Chemistry of Jabir," and
                                        "Master of Chemists."</p>
                                    <h4><strong>Early Life</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Jabir ibn Hayyan grew up in Tus and worked alongside his father in the apothecary trade.
                                        From a young age, he was curious about natural phenomena, asking his father questions
                                        about nature, herbs, plants, their cultivation, and their benefits or harms. He also
                                        studied the properties of metals. Recognizing Jabir’s potential to become a great
                                        scholar, his father ensured he received extensive education in medicine, botany,
                                        chemistry, and ancient philosophy.</p>
                                    <h4><strong>Fields of Study</strong></h4>
                                    <h5>Chemistry</h5>
                                    <p>Jabir ibn Hayyan is considered one of the earliest scholars to focus on chemistry. He is
                                        regarded as a pioneer in advancing both chemistry and experimental sciences. His name
                                        became closely associated with the experimental method due to his approach of conducting
                                        chemical experiments in his private laboratory. He didn’t rely solely on ancient
                                        chemical texts and theories but actively conducted experiments, leading to the discovery
                                        of new chemical compounds previously unknown.
                                        Jabir’s experimental method in chemistry is summarized as follows:

                                    <ul class="justify-text">
                                        <li>The experimenter must understand the purpose and reason behind the experiment.</li>
                                        <li>They should be well-versed in the guidelines and instructions.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid undertaking impossible steps.</li>
                                        <li>Conduct experiments in a designated, isolated laboratory away from residential
                                            areas.</li>
                                        <li>Surround themselves with trustworthy colleagues.</li>
                                        <li>Dedicate sufficient time to perform experiments accurately.</li>
                                        <li>Be patient and avoid being deceived by appearances, taking time to carefully analyze
                                            results</li>
                                    </ul>

                                            as the
                                            "Alembic," derived from the Arabic word "Al-Inbiq." He also enhanced the quality of
                                            the
                                            glass used in this tool by adding manganese dioxide.</li>

                                    <h5>Astronomy</h5>
                                    <p>Jabir studied astronomy, defining it as the structure of the external universe. He
                                        described its substance as the elements that fill this structure. According to Jabir,
                                        the external universe consists of four fundamental elements: moisture, coldness,
                                        dryness, and heat. These elements combine to form various substances, with coldness and
                                        heat acting as active elements, while moisture and dryness are passive. </p>
                                    <h5>Natural Sciences</h5>
                                    <p>Jabir explored nature, particularly plants, animals, and stones. He classified animals
                                        into four categories: flying, crawling, swimming, and walking, noting that each category
                                        possesses moisture, coldness, essence, dryness, heat, and a spirit, all coexisting in
                                        time and space. He viewed plants as intermediate between stones and animals, sharing
                                        with animals traits like moisture, heat, essence, dryness, and coldness but lacking
                                        intellect. In his book Kitab al-Tasrif, he emphasized that plants lack both intellect
                                        and spirit. Jabir also categorized stones into eight types:</p>

                                    <p>Jabir ibn Hayyan authored numerous books across a variety of scientific and philosophical
                                        disciplines. Some of his most notable works include:</p>
