                                <article>
                                    <p>Widely known as "Avicenna," Ibn Sina was a remarkable polymath whose contributions
                                        spanned diverse fields, including medicine, psychology, pharmacology, geology, physics,
                                        astronomy, chemistry, and philosophy. He was also an accomplished poet, Islamic scholar,
                                        and theologian. His most significant medical work was Al-Qanun Fi Al-Tibb (The Canon of
                                        Medicine), a monumental five-volume encyclopedia containing over a million words,
                                        compiling medical knowledge from ancient and Islamic sources. Another major work, The
                                        Book of Healing, served as both a scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.</p>
                                    <h2><strong>Early Life</strong></h2>
                                    <p>Ibn Sina was born around 980 A.D. in the village of Afshana near Bukhara, present-day
                                        Uzbekistan, which was also his mother’s hometown. His father, Abdullah, an advocate of
                                        the Ismaili sect, was originally from Balkh, now in Afghanistan. By age 10, Ibn Sina had
                                        memorized the Quran, earning the title of Hafiz, and by 14, he had surpassed his
                                        teachers with his exceptional intellectual abilities. He pursued studies in
                                        jurisprudence, philosophy, natural science, logic, Euclid, and Ptolemy’s Almagest.
                                        Struggling initially to comprehend Aristotle's work on metaphysics, he turned to prayer
                                        and ultimately found clarity through a manual by philosopher al-Farabi.</p>
                                    <h2><strong>Contributions and Achievements</strong></h2>
                                    <p>By age 16, Ibn Sina focused on medicine and, by 18, became a renowned physician. His
                                        reputation soared after curing Nuh II, the ruler of the Samanids, from a severe illness
                                        that had confounded other physicians. In gratitude, the ruler granted him access to an
                                        exclusive royal library, which further enriched his studies.
                                        After his father’s death, 22-year-old Ibn Sina moved to Jurjan near the Caspian Sea,
                                        where he lectured on logic and astronomy. There, he met the famous scholar Abu Rayhan
                                        al-Biruni. Later, he traveled to Rey and Hamadan (both in present-day Iran), where he
                                        taught, wrote extensively, and cured Shams al-Dawla, the Emir of Hamadan, from a
                                        critical illness. His epic works were completed in Isfahan, though political turmoil and
                                        overexertion took a toll on his health. In his final years, he served Ala al-Dawla
                                        Muhammad, a military commander, as a physician and scientific advisor. Ibn Sina died in
                                        June 1037 A.D. at the age of 58 and was buried in Hamadan, Iran.

                                    <h2><strong>His Work</strong></h2>
                                    <p>Ibn Sina's The Canon of Medicine was his most notable contribution to medical science.
                                        This massive encyclopedia, comprising over a million words, became a cornerstone of
                                        medical knowledge and was translated into Latin in the 12th century, serving as the
                                        standard medical text in European universities until the mid-17th century.
                                        Another seminal work, The Book of Healing, was intended to "heal" the soul and covered
                                        four areas: logic, natural sciences, mathematics, and metaphysics. In this book, he
                                        introduced "Avicennian logic" and made significant astronomical contributions, including
                                        proposing that Venus was closer to the Sun than the Earth and inventing an instrument
                                        for observing star coordinates. He also observed that stars are self-luminous and
                                        developed mathematical concepts such as the "casting out of nines."
                                        In addition to his scientific pursuits, Ibn Sina wrote poetry and contributed to music
                                        and religious studies. Out of over 400 works attributed to him, about 240 have survived,
                                        solidifying his legacy as one of history’s greatest minds.

                                        <p>Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (864 CE – November 19, 923 CE), known in the
                                            West as Rhazes, was a Persian-born Muslim physician, chemist, philosopher, and
                                            mathematician, as well as a leading figure of the Golden Age of Science. Sigrid
                                            Hunke, in her book The Sun of Arabs Shines on the West, described him as "the
                                            greatest physician of all time." Al-Razi authored Al-Hawi fi al-Tibb (The
                                            Comprehensive Book on Medicine), which compiled medical knowledge from Greek sources
                                            up to 925 CE and remained a key medical reference in Europe for 400 years. His
                                            expertise extended across mathematics, medicine, philosophy, astronomy, chemistry,
                                            logic, and literature.</p>
                                        <p>Al-Razi earned fame in Rayy (modern-day Tehran), where he led a hospital, traveled
                                            widely, and wrote extensively on diseases. Many of his works, translated into Latin,
                                            influenced medicine until the 17th century. Among his most notable texts are The
                                            History of Medicine, Kitab al-Mansuri fi al-Tibb (The Book of Medicine Dedicated to
                                            Al-Mansur), and Kitab al-Adwiyah al-Mufradah (The Book of Simple Drugs), which
                                            features detailed anatomical descriptions. He pioneered surgical sutures, developed
                                            ointments, and advanced pharmacology through groundbreaking contributions. Over his
                                            lifetime, he authored more than 200 works on various scientific subjects.</p>
                                        <h4><strong>Life and Education</strong></h4>
                                        <p>Al-Razi was likely born in Rayy around 865 CE. He advocated for medical students to
                                            train in densely populated cities, where they could encounter diverse cases and
                                            learn from experienced physicians. Contrary to earlier misconceptions, evidence from
                                            an Oxford Bodleian Library manuscript, Experiments, suggests he practiced medicine
                                            in his youth, spending time in Baghdad to study.</p>
                                        <p>After his studies, Al-Razi returned to Rayy to manage its hospital at the request of
                                            the local governor, Mansur ibn Ishaq, to whom he dedicated Kitab al-Mansuri fi
                                            al-Tibb and Al-Tibb al-Ruhani (Spiritual Medicine). The former addressed physical
                                            illnesses, while the latter focused on mental health. He later served as the head of
                                            Al-Mu’tadidi Hospital in Baghdad, established by Caliph Al-Mu’tadid. In his later
                                            years, Al-Razi returned to Rayy, where he went blind due to cataracts and passed
                                            away in 923 or 932 CE.

                                        <h4><strong>Character and Philosophy</strong></h4>
                                        <p>Al-Razi’s writings reflect his humility and simplicity. In The Philosophical
                                            Biography, he wrote:
                                            "No greed for wealth, no extravagance, no disputes or injustices can be attributed
                                            to me. My conduct in food, drink, attire, and possessions remains modest and free
                                            from excess."</p>
                                        <p>He emphasized the primacy of reason in his work. In Spiritual Medicine, he stated:
                                            "Reason is the supreme judge and guide; it must not be subjugated or overruled but
                                            should remain the master to whom all things are referred."</p>
                                        <p>Al-Razi admired Socratic philosophy and promoted its application to science. He
                                            believed in building upon the work of predecessors, stating in Al-Mansuri:
                                            "One cannot advance in science without building on the work of earlier scholars. A
                                            single lifetime is insufficient to acquire the knowledge they amassed over
                                            centuries. Thus, those who follow their path achieve in a short time what took them
                                            lifetimes."</p>

                                        <p>Ibn al-Nafis, born Ala al-Din Abu al-Hassan Ali Ibn Abi-Hazm al-Qarshi al-Dimashqi in
                                            1213 in Damascus, was a prominent figure in medieval Islamic science. He studied
                                            medicine at the Bimaristan al-Noori in Damascus and later worked in Cairo at the
                                            Al-Nassri and Al-Mansouri hospitals, ultimately becoming the chief physician at the
                                            latter. At just 29, he published his influential Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's
                                            Canon, where he introduced pioneering ideas on pulmonary circulation and heart
                                            function. Although he also worked on an ambitious medical encyclopedia, The
                                            Comprehensive Book of Medicine, it was never completed. Ibn al-Nafis was a Sunni
                                            Muslim, but his intellectual pursuits spanned law, philosophy, theology, sociology,
                                            astronomy, and even literature. He is credited with writing one of the earliest
                                            Arabic novels, Theologus Autodidactus, a science-fiction tale about a child raised
                                            on an isolated island.</p>
                                        <h4><strong>Pulmonary Circulation</strong></h4>
                                        <p>During Ibn al-Nafis' time, the medical theories of Galen and Avicenna were widely
                                            accepted. Galen's model described blood as being formed in the liver and then
                                            passing to the right ventricle, where it was believed to travel through invisible
                                            pores in the heart's septum to the left ventricle. This theory lasted for over a
                                            millennium despite its puzzling nature. According to Galen, blood then became "vital
                                            spirit" in the left ventricle, where it mixed with air and spread throughout the
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>In contrast, Ibn al-Nafis, in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon, made
                                            three key advancements:
                                        </p>
                                        <ol class="justify-text">
                                            <li>He rejected Galen's idea of porous heart septa. He asserted that the heart’s
                                                interventricular septum is solid and does not allow blood to pass through.</li>
                                            <li>He argued that the blood from the right ventricle must reach the left
                                                ventricle via the lungs, not through any septal pores.</li>
                                            <li>3. Ibn al-Nafis predicted the existence of small connections between the
                                                pulmonary artery and vein, which was later confirmed as the pulmonary
                                                capillaries by Marcello Malpighi in the 17th century.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>It took several centuries before European scholars, including Michael Servetus,
                                            recognized that blood must pass through the lungs to reach the left ventricle.
                                            Servetus was the first to describe this in 1553, and similar ideas were later echoed
                                            by Realdus Columbus, Andreas Vesalius, and William Harvey. Harvey’s experiments in
                                            the 17th century confirmed the pulmonary circulation, though he had initially
                                            struggled with the concept.</p>
                                        <p> Interestingly, Ibn al-Nafis’ manuscript was rediscovered only about 80 years ago by
                                            Egyptian physician Muhyo Al-Deen el Tatawi, who found it in the Prussian State
                                            Library in Berlin. Max Meyerhof, a renowned orientalist, later translated and
                                            published parts of Ibn al-Nafis' work, bringing his contributions to light in the
                                            West.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Despite the similarities between Ibn al-Nafis' and Servetus' ideas, it's unclear
                                            whether Servetus was aware of Ibn al-Nafis' work. Although some translations of Ibn
                                            al-Nafis' writings had been made earlier, they did not include his theories on
                                            pulmonary circulation. Many historians believe Servetus independently discovered
                                            this concept, but both Ibn al-Nafis and Servetus are credited with advancing our
                                            understanding of blood circulation in the body.
