                                    <p>Hassan Ibn al-Haytham (commonly Latinized as Alhazen, c. 965–c. 1040) was a prominent
                                        mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age, hailing from what is
                                        now
                                        Iraq. Known as "the father of modern optics," he made groundbreaking contributions to
                                        the
                                        understanding of optics and visual perception. His most influential work, Kitāb
                                        al-Manāẓir
                                        (The Book of Optics), written between 1011 and 1021, significantly shaped scientific
                                        thought
                                        and was later cited by figures such as Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Christiaan
                                        Huygens,
                                        and Galileo Galilei during the scientific revolution.</p>
                                    <p>Ibn al-Haytham was the first to accurately explain the theory of vision, arguing that
                                        vision
                                        occurs in the brain rather than the eyes and is influenced by personal experience. He
                                        also
                                        introduced the principle of least time for refraction, later formalized as Fermat's
                                        principle. His research on reflection, refraction, and the behavior of light advanced
                                        the
                                        fields of catoptrics and dioptrics. He emphasized the importance of hypotheses being
                                        tested
                                        through experiments and mathematical reasoning, positioning him as a pioneer of the
                                        scientific method centuries before the Renaissance. Often referred to as the "world’s
                                        first
                                        true scientist," Ibn al-Haytham also contributed to philosophy, theology, and medicine.
                                        Born in Basra, Iraq, to a family of either Arab or Persian origin, Ibn al-Haytham
                                        initially
                                        studied religion before turning to mathematics and science. He served as a vizier in
                                        Basra
                                        and gained fame for his engineering expertise, including a plan to regulate the flooding
                                        of
                                        the Nile. Later, in Cairo, he held an administrative role under the Fatimid Caliph
                                        Al-Hakim
                                        but faced difficulties fulfilling his duties. According to legend, he feigned madness
                                        and
                                        lived under house arrest until Al-Hakim's death in 1021, during which time he wrote The
                                        Book
                                        of Optics. He spent the remainder of his life in Cairo, living off his writings, and
                                        died
                                        around 1040.</p>
                                    <h4><strong>The Book of Optics</strong></h4>
                                    <p>The Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham’s seven-volume treatise, was written between 1011 and
                                        1021 and became one of his most influential works. He was the first to propose that
                                        vision
                                        occurs when light reflects off objects and enters the eyes, and he demonstrated that
                                        perception occurs in the brain. The treatise was translated into Latin in the 12th or
                                        13th
                                        century, gaining widespread recognition during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. It was
                                        printed in 1572 under the title Opticae Thesaurus, further solidifying its impact.</p>
                                    <h4><strong>Contributions to Optics and Vision</strong></h4>
                                    <p>In classical antiquity, two main theories of vision prevailed: the emission theory (eyes
                                        emit light) and the intromission theory (objects send physical forms into the eye). Ibn
                                        al-Haytham synthesized ideas from earlier thinkers like Ptolemy, Euclid, and Galen to
                                        propose a more comprehensive theory. He argued that light and color travel in straight
                                        lines
                                        from objects and that the eye perceives only the perpendicular rays entering it,
                                        resolving
                                        issues of image formation. Although some aspects of his theory were later refined, his
                                        work
                                        laid the foundation for modern optics, influencing later scientists like Kepler, who
                                        built
                                        on his framework to develop the theory of retinal imaging.</p>
                                    <p> Ibn al-Haytham’s contributions to the understanding of light, vision, and the scientific
                                        method were revolutionary, shaping the course of science for centuries and earning him
                                        recognition as one of the greatest minds of the Islamic Golden Age.

                                        <p>Badīʿ az-Zaman Abu l-ʿIzz ibn Ismāʿīl al-Jazarī (1136–1206) was a prominent Muslim
                                        polymath from Mesopotamia, known for his contributions as a scholar, inventor,
                                        mechanical engineer, artisan, and artist. He is most famous for his book The Book of
                                        Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices (1206), which described 50 mechanical devices,
                                        including instructions for constructing them. His work laid the foundation for modern
                                        robotics, earning him the title "father of robotics." Notably, he invented the famous
                                        elephant clock and he is the father of the modern shafts used in car engines. Leonardo

                                        <p>Al-Jazari was born in 1136 in Upper Mesopotamia, though his exact birthplace is
                                        uncertain. He served as the chief engineer at the Artuqid Palace, working under the
                                        Artuqid dynasty, a vassal of the Zengid and later the Ayyubid dynasty. His background is
                                        unclear, with sources variously describing him as Arab, Kurdish, or Persian. Al-Jazari's
                                        work was more focused on craftsmanship than theoretical innovation, often relying on
                                        trial and error to assemble his machines. His book was widely circulated and described
                                        devices he personally constructed, resembling a modern "do-it-yourself" guide.
                                        Al-Jazari was influenced by earlier engineers, such as the Banū Mūsā brothers and
                                        Pseudo-Archimedes, but he improved upon their designs and introduced original
                                        innovations, including mechanisms not seen before. His inventions included early
                                        examples of the crankshaft, crank-slider mechanisms, and water-raising machines, which
                                        had significant impact on modern engineering.</p>
                                        <p>In 1206, the Artuqid ruler commissioned Al-Jazari to produce the first edition of his
                                        Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices. Al-Jazari’s machines featured
                                        advanced mechanisms such as camshafts and crankshafts, which transformed rotary motion
                                        into linear motion—a fundamental principle in modern machinery.</p>
                                        <p>He introduced several innovative construction methods, such as using wooden templates,
                                        calibrating orifices, and casting metals with sand molds. His hydropowered machines
                                        included the saqiya chain pump and the double-action suction pump, which employed the
                                        crankshaft and connecting rod mechanism, innovations vital to the development of
                                        engines. His pumps could lift water to remarkable heights, demonstrating early
                                        applications of suction pipes and reciprocating motion.</p>
                                        <p>Al-Jazari also designed complex water systems and fountains, many with automata, such as
                                        a musical robot band and a drink-serving waitress. His automata were not only for
                                        entertainment but also served practical functions, such as a hand-washing device with a
                                        flush mechanism and a peacock fountain that dispensed water and offered soap.
                                        He contributed greatly to the development of water clocks, including portable,
                                        astronomical, and candle-powered clocks. His elephant clock, for instance, was a
                                        remarkable innovation that included an automaton responding at set intervals and an
                                        accurate method for tracking time throughout the year.</p>
                                        <p>Al-Jazari's work in automata, clockmaking, and water-driven machinery had a lasting
                                        influence on both engineering and entertainment, making him a central figure in the
                                        history of mechanical innovation.</p>
